                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        Hello! I'm Ryan Byers, a passionate Computer Science student with a focus on software and web development. Right now, I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I expect to graduate in May of 2025.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                        My interest in technology began in 2016 when I discovered it was possible to build my own desktop PC. Performing the research needed to build my own PC led me down the rabbit hole that I still find myself in now 10 years later. I discovered through this that I am particularly interested in web development and creating software that solves real-world problems.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games, working on 3-D printed models, or working on personal programming projects. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
