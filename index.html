                <p>I like to spend most of my time working on personal projects to challenge myself and improve my abilities as a programmer. When I am not doing that, I like to go to the gym, go for runs when the weather is good, and play videogames.</p>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>I am working on a project that utilizes the popular SDL2 library to create a 3-D renderer. The project is still in progress, but I am working right now on programming the ability to shade 3-D projected objects to the screen. I would like to bring the project to a point in which I can simulate basic physics interactions between basic objects on the screen.</p>
                <p>With this being said, when it comes to my interest regarding projects, most of my interest lies in low level implementations. The challenge of using only SDL2 and as such forgoing a graphical API such as OpenGL provides me with additional challenges.</p>
                <p>One of the main challenges lies in the fact that SDL2 is designed to be paired with a graphical API. It does not provide a 3-D coordinate space, nor does it provide implementations of crucial functions involved in the rendering pipeline that are present in traditional 3-D renderers. SDL2 provides functions that allow the collection of user input, creating a window, and drawing pixels and lines to the screen. Anything that must be done in 3-D is something that has to be implemented using custom, user created modules.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, the challenge lies in the implementations of functions required to produce a 3-D rendering pipeline. This involves the implementation of things such as the projection matrix to take objects that are defined in a three dimensional space and project them onto a two dimensional space (the screen), linear transformation matrices allow for objects to be rotated, translated, scaled, etc., and eventually, implementation for functions that have the ability to calculate normal vectors with respect to vertices that are a part of a mesh in order to allow proper shading that takes into account variables related to light sources and perspective.</p>
                <p>The creation of a project of this scale has been hard, and it has taken me many hours to even get the program to the point at which is being displayed now, but it has taught me valuable lessons through the many mistakes I've made.</p>
                <p>One such mistake I made early on was not making my code more modular. I put too many important variables in too little of a space, and this caused me many issues as I continued development. The process of refactoring my earlier written code was quite frankly a nightmare, but as I stated before, it taught me a valuable lesson: always utilize modular programming techniques. I learned the hard way that this is even more important early on in a project, as when one continues to build on code that is not modularized, the amount of refactoring one has to perform later on in development exponentially.</p>
                <p>Another thing this project has done for me is aquanting me more intimately me with GitHub. I learned that being specific and using the correct terminology when making commits is incredibly important, and as such it has become a prime concern of mine as I have progressed further and further thorugh this project.</p>
