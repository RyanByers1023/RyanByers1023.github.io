                <p>Greetings, my name is Ryan Byers. I am currently enrolled at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in Kansas City, Missouri in the pursuit of a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am set to graduate next Spring (Spring 2025).</p>
                <p>I like to spend most of my time working on personal projects to challenge myself and improve my abilities as a programmer. When I am not doing that, I like to go to the gym, go out for runs, and play videogames.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="projects" data-tab-content>
                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>I am currently working on my first large scale project that's goal is to utilize a multimedia library called SDL2 to create a 3-D renderer from scratch using C++. The project is still in progress, but I am working right now on programming the ability to shade 3-D projected objects to the screen. I would like to bring the project to a point in which I can simulate basic physics interactions between basic objects on the screen.</p>
                <p>One of the main challenges lies in the fact that SDL2 is designed to be paired with a graphical API. It does not provide a 3-D coordinate space, nor does it provide implementations of crucial functions involved in the rendering pipeline that are present in traditional 3-D renderers. SDL2 provides functions that allow the collection of user input, creating a window, and drawing pixels and lines to the screen. Anything that must be done in 3-D is something that has to be implemented using custom, user created modules.</p>
                <p>The challenge lies in the planning and designing of implementations required to produce a 3-D rendering pipeline. This involves implementing a projection matrix to take objects that are defined in a three dimensional space and project them onto a two dimensional space (the screen), linear transformation matrices that allow for objects to be rotated, translated, scaled, etc., and eventually even implementing functions that give me the ability to calculate normals on my world objects' vertices in order to allow proper shading that utilizes the camera's position/angle relative to said world objects to simulate simple light reflections, and to also determine whether or not a part of an object needs to be rendered (for example: the back side of an opaque object should not be rendered given its front side is facing towards the camera, while the front side should be rendered assuming the object itself is within the field of view of the camera). </p>
                <p>The creation of a project of this scale has been time consuming and arduous, and it has taken me many hours to get the program to the point at which is being displayed now, but it has taught me many valuable lessons through the mistakes I've made along the way.</p>
                <p>One such mistake I made early on was not making my code more modular. I put too many important variables/functions in too little of a space, and this caused many issues as I continued development. The process of refactoring my earlier written code was quite frankly a nightmare, but as I stated before, it taught me a valuable lesson: always utilize modular programming techniques. I learned the hard way that this is even more important early on in a project, as when one continues to build on code that is not modularized, organized, and planned out ahead of time, the amount of refactoring one has to perform later on in development increases exponentially. Refactoring is a totally normal part of any project, but the amount that needs to be done can surely be reduced with these thoughts in mind.</p>
                <p>Additionally, this project has aquanted me much more intimately me with GitHub. I learned that being specific and using the correct terminology when making commits is incredibly important, and as such it has become a prime concern of mine as I have progressed further and further thorugh this project. I find that sometimes I come back to my project days later wanting to know what the last contribution/additon was that I has made. Early on when I was not making commits with specifc messages, this was sometimes hard, and I would be forced to dig through and re-read sections of my code that looked new to figure this out. This is an easy problem to solve so as long as I make a genuine effort to make good commits.</p>
                <p>Anyway, below is a short demo that represents the current state of the project:</p>
                <img id="renderer-demo" src="RendererDemo.gif" />
                <p>As you can see, it is still very much a work in progress, but I am hopeful that I can get this project to a point that can be deemed somewhat visually impressive given the limitations I've set for myself. Below I will link to my GitHub for any one interested enough to want to check it out in code form:</p>
